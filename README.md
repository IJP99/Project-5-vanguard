# Vanguard A/B Test
### Improving the online customer experience

## Project Overview
Vanguard performed an A/B test on two variations of an online, customer facing process. This project aims to analyse the data generated by the experiement and conclude which online process performed the best.

## Installation and Setup
### Codes and Resources Used
- Jupyter Notebook 7.2.0
- Python 3.11.7
- Tableau 2024.1.3
### Python Packages Used
- Statistics: `scipy`
- Data Manipulation: `pandas` and `numpy`
- Data Visualization: `plotly`, `matplotlib`

To install external libraries, first navigate to the `./project/` directory and activate `venv-wk5-project`
1. <pre>cd ./project</pre>
2. <pre>source venv/bin/activate</pre>
Use `pip` to install external libraries:
1. <pre>pip install notebook</pre>
2. <pre>pip install pandas</pre>
3. <pre>pip install plotly</pre>
4. <pre>pip install matplotlib</pre>
5. <pre>pip install scipy</pre>

## Data
### Source Data
The data for this project was sourced from the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp repository: [github.com/data-bootcamp-v4](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/tree/main/5_6_eda_inf_stats_tableau/project/files_for_project)
There are 4 unique datasets in .txt format:
  1. `df_final_demo.txt` - this includes client information.
  2. `df_final_experiment_clients.txt` - this includes information about which client belongs to which group - "test" or "control".
  3. `df_final_web_data_pt_1.txt` - information about web activity part 1.
  4. `df_final_web_data_pt_2.txt` - information about web activity part 2.

### Data procesing
**Step 1.** import all the libraries in order to use pandas to merge all of them into a bigger data frame to work
**Step 2.** Rename the columns following the same pattern
**Step 3.** drop all the null values, we can do this because the population of the sample is big enough to still give us confident in the results
**Step 4.** We start to analyze the completion rate knowing the total amounts of "confirms" that we have also modifing the "date" column format and the "confirm" value to "z_confirm" for future structure in ascendant and descendant orders
**Step 5.** Get the completion rate by group of study (control and test)
**Step 6.** Get the proportion of errors (Understanding error as go to a previous step in any moment)
**Step 7.** Get the time spend between each step and comparing then with hypothesis testing to reject or not the null hypothesis based on the p-value result
